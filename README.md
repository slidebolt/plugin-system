# System Plugin for Slidebolt

The System Plugin provides core monitoring and management capabilities for the host system running Slidebolt. It exposes system metrics like CPU usage, memory, and disk space as Slidebolt entities.

## Features

- **System Monitoring**: Tracks host CPU, Memory, and Disk usage.
- **Isolated Service**: Runs as a standalone sidecar service communicating via NATS.

## Architecture

This plugin follows the Slidebolt "Isolated Service" pattern:
- **`pkg/bundle`**: Implementation of the `sdk.Plugin` interface.
- **`pkg/pkg_logic`**: Core logic for system metric collection.
- **`cmd/main.go`**: Service entry point.

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Go (v1.25.6+)
- Slidebolt `plugin-sdk` and `plugin-framework` repos sitting as siblings.

### Local Build
Initialize the Go workspace to link sibling dependencies:
```bash
go work init . ../plugin-sdk ../plugin-framework
go build -o bin/plugin-system ./cmd/main.go
```

### Testing
```bash
go test ./...
```

## Docker Deployment

### Build the Image
To build with local sibling modules:
```bash
make docker-build-local
```

To build from remote GitHub repositories:
```bash
make docker-build-prod
```

### Run via Docker Compose
Add the following to your `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
services:
  system-plugin:
    image: slidebolt-plugin-system:latest
    environment:
      - NATS_URL=nats://core:4222
